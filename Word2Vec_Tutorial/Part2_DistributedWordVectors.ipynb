    "## Introducing Distributed Word Vectors\n",
    "This part of the tutorial will focus on using distributed word vectors created by the Word2Vec algorithm. (For an overview of deep learning, as well as pointers to some additional tutorials, see the \"What is Deep Learning?\" page).\n",
    "\n",
    "Parts 2 and 3 assume more familiarity with Python than Part 1. We developed the following code on a dual-core Macbook Pro, however, we have not yet run the code successfully on Windows. If you are a Windows user and you get it working, please leave a note on how you did it in the forum! For more detail, see the \"Setting Up Your System\" page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2vec, published by Google in 2013, is a neural network implementation that learns distributed representations for words. Other deep or recurrent neural network architectures had been proposed for learning word representations prior to this, but the major problem with these was the long time required to train the models. Word2vec learns quickly relative to other models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2Vec does not need labels in order to create meaningful representations. This is useful, since most data in the real world is unlabeled. If the network is given enough training data (tens of billions of words), it produces word vectors with intriguing characteristics. Words with similar meanings appear in clusters, and clusters are spaced such that some word relationships, such as analogies, can be reproduced using vector math. The famous example is that, with highly trained word vectors, \"king - man + woman = queen.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out Google's code, writeup, and the accompanying papers. This presentation is also helpful. The original code is in C, but it has since been ported to other languages, including Python. We encourage you to play with the original C tool, but be warned that it is not user-friendly if you are a beginning programmer (we had to manually edit the header files to compile it).\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent work out of Stanford has also applied deep learning to sentiment analysis; their code is available in Java. However, their approach, which relies on sentence parsing, cannot be applied in a straightforward way to paragraphs of arbitrary length.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distributed word vectors are powerful and can be used for many applications, particularly word prediction and translation. Here, we will try to apply them to sentiment analysis.\n",

    "With the list of nicely parsed sentences, we're ready to train the model. There are a number of parameter choices that affect the run time and the quality of the final model that is produced. For details on the algorithms below, see the word2vec API documentation as well as the Google documentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Architecture: Architecture options are skip-gram (default) or continuous bag of words. We found that skip-gram was very slightly slower but produced better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Training algorithm: Hierarchical softmax (default) or negative sampling. For us, the default worked well.\n",
    "Downsampling of frequent words: The Google documentation recommends values between .00001 and .001. For us, values closer 0.001 seemed to improve the accuracy of the final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Word vector dimensionality: More features result in longer runtimes, and often, but not always, result in better models. Reasonable values can be in the tens to hundreds; we used 300.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Context / window size: How many words of context should the training algorithm take into account? 10 seems to work well for hierarchical softmax (more is better, up to a point).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Worker threads: Number of parallel processes to run. This is computer-specific, but between 4 and 6 should work on most systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Minimum word count: This helps limit the size of the vocabulary to meaningful words. Any word that does not occur at least this many times across all documents is ignored. Reasonable values could be between 10 and 100. In this case, since each movie occurs 30 times, we set the minimum word count to 40, to avoid attaching too much importance to individual movie titles. This resulted in an overall vocabulary size of around 15,000 words. Higher values also help limit run time.\n",
